# Product Visualization in Augmented Reality on Web

This is a Augmented Reality project made using Unity, C# and BlippAR SDK.
In this project I have created Augmented Reality web application, which scans for surface to place a product and places the product. User can drag, scale and rotate the product. User can see the product related information on the web page itself.
